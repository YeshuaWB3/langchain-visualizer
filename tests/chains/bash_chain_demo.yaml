      Question: "copy the files in the directory named ''target'' into a new directory
      at the same level as target called ''myNewDirectory''"


      I need to take the following actions:

      - List all files in the directory

      - Create a new directory

      - Copy the files from the first directory into the second directory

      ```bash

      ls

      mkdir myNewDirectory

      cp -r target/* myNewDirectory

      ```


      That is the format. Begin!
