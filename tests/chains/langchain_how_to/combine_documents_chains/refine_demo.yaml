      we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \n\nWe can do both.
      At our border, we\u2019ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners
      to better detect drug smuggling.  \n\nWe\u2019ve set up joint patrols with Mexico
      and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \n\nWe\u2019re putting in place
      dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can
      have their cases heard faster. \n\nWe\u2019re securing commitments and supporting

      Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans

      from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \n\nAnd soon,
      we\u2019ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three
      decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together
